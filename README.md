✅ Overview
This simple Python program prints different triangle patterns using asterisks (*). It helps beginners:

Understand Python loops (especially for loops),

Learn how to work with strings and spacing,

Improve logical thinking and pattern generation.

🛠️ Technologies Used
💻 Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

🐍 Python 3.x

🚀 How to Use
Open Google Colab.

Create a new Python notebook.

Copy and paste the desired pattern code from this repo.

Run the code cell using Shift + Enter.

See the pattern printed in the output.


📖 Code Explanation
Left-Aligned Triangle:
range(1, rows + 1) gives line numbers.

'*' * i prints i number of asterisks.

Center-Aligned Pyramid:
' ' * (rows - i) adds spaces before * to center it.

'*' * (2 * i - 1) ensures odd number of * to form the pyramid shape.

🎛️ Customization
Want different shapes? You can easily tweak:

rows = X → to increase/decrease size.

Use nested loops for hollow triangles or inverted shapes.

Replace * with any other character like #, $, etc.
